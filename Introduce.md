I - Introduction:
- Pikachu is a classic tile-matching puzzle game developed and released by the Japanese company Nintendo in 1996. The game features a grid of variously shaped tiles, each displaying a different kind of Pokemon character, including the popular Pikachu. The objective of the game is to clear the board by matching pairs of identical tiles.

- Players can only select and match tiles that are adjacent to each other and have at least one free side. As tiles are matched, they disappear from the board, and the remaining tiles shift to fill the gaps.

- Pikachu is a challenging and addictive game that requires players to think strategically and plan their moves ahead of time. The game features multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty, and players can earn higher scores by completing levels quickly and with fewer moves.

- Over the years, Pikachu has become one of the most popular and recognizable games in the world, and it has been released on a variety of platforms, including mobile devices and gaming consoles. Its cute and colorful graphics, engaging gameplay, and nostalgic appeal continue to attract players of all ages.

II. Detailed Description
    1. This mode contains the essential steps to make the game possible.
        A. Game starting: Initialize a board with the given size while satisfying the following conditions
            - The total number of cells must be even.
            - The number of distinct characters is specified in advance.
            - For each character, determine an even number to define the number of occurrences for that character.
        B. Characters on the two cells must be identical.
            - When the cells disappear, their positions are replaced with blank spaces.
            - The matching pattern must be one of the below motifs.
                + I Matching
                + L Matching
                + U Matching
                + Z Matching
        C. Game finishing: check the following conditions
            - Are there any cells left?
            - Are there any valid pairs left?
    2. Difficult Mode
        - In this mode, the neighboring cells should slide into the newly emptied spaces in a particular direction (left to right, up to down, etc.) Students may decide to use Pointer, LinkedList, or both for implementation. If you choose to use both data structures, only one is needed to make the game run, and the other should help with the report (The details will be given below).
    3. Advaned Features
        - Players will experience the game better if you can add one (or more) of the following extra features to the game.
        - Color and sound effects
        - Visual effects (Figure 6)
        - Background: You can design anything for a background. Then, when a matching pair disappears, the background content corresponds to those emptied cells.
        - Move suggestion: Show player a valid match when they press the "Help" key.
